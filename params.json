Look no further! Network Log is for you!**\r\n\r\nNetwork Log monitors iptables-logging to display a real-time list of which apps are making network connections, and provides statistics about those app connections.\r\n\r\n##**Real-time log display**\r\n\r\nThe log tab shows the network packets being transmitted and their details such as:\r\n\r\n  * source and destination addresses/ports\r\n  * network protocol and interface\r\n  * bytes transmitted\r\n  * timestamp \r\n\r\n##**Real-time network usage statistics**\r\n\r\nThe applications tab lists installed applications along with network usage statistics such as:\r\n\r\n  * total packets and bytes sent\r\n  * active network throughput speed in Bps/Kbps/Mbps\r\n  * timestamp of last connection\r\n  * list of all the unique connections made by each app\r\n  * sortable and filterable\r\n\r\n##**Real-time connection notifications**\r\n\r\nThe statusbar icon's up/down arrows will highlight when upload/download traffic occurs, and the notification drop-down shade displays the connection throughput speed in Kbps.\r\n\r\nYou can also configure toast pop-up notifications on a per-app basis that will pop-up a temporary notification containing connection details no matter which app you are in.\r\n\r\n##**Graphs**\r\n\r\nClick an app in either tab to see time-lines of its connections.\r\n\r\nSelect the 'Apps Timeline' menu item to see an over-all time-line of all apps.\r\n\r\nAdjustable interval from 1 ms to 48 hours for summing data:\r\n\r\n  * to see each packet, set to 1 ms\r\n  * for Kbps, set to 1 second\r\n  * for Kb-per-hour, set to 1 hour; etc\r\n\r\nAdjustable **_pinch-zoomable_** and **_scrollable_** graphs.\r\n\r\n_Requires rooted devices._\r\n\r\nFull source code available at [https://github.com/pragma-/networklog](https://github.com/pragma-/networklog).\r\n\r\n_Note: While the app itself is designed to use minimal CPU/battery, you can further reduce the CPU/battery use by exiting the app after starting the logging service._\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Z1bwVUG.jpg\"><img height=\"535\" width=\"320\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Z1bwVUG.jpg\"></img></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/NwpzkkA.jpg\"><img height=\"535\" width=\"320\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NwpzkkA.jpg\"></img></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/5NPPvXf.jpg\"><img height=\"535\" width=\"320\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/5NPPvXf.jpg\"></img></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/PHnXZFk.jpg\"><img height=\"535\" width=\"320\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/PHnXZFk.jpg\"></img></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/x9hl4tK.jpg\"><img height=\"535\" width=\"320\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/x9hl4tK.jpg\"></img></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Um7OArJ.jpg\"><img height=\"535\" width=\"320\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Um7OArJ.jpg\"></img></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/hND5qlO.jpg\"><img height=\"535\" width=\"320\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/hND5qlO.jpg\"></img></a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/rzL0GXf.jpg\"><img height=\"535\" width=\"320\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rzL0GXf.jpg\"></img></a>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
